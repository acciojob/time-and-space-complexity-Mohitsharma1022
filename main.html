	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity </h1>
	<p>Time Complexity</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity </b>refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution.Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we create a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will require O(n2) space</p>
